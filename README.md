# Programming1-and-Programming2
This includes all homework assignments and programming exams from Trident Technical College's C++ Programming 1 and C++ Programming 2. Each program folder includes the original program requirements for reference purposes.

For Programming 1, we were required to create flowcharts before writing any code, and these flowcharts are included.
